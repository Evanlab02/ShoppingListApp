### Items Page

![Items List View](./assets/items.png)

This page shows all the items you've created, and you can navigate to their details, edit, or delete them from here. You can also access the store details to view all items in that store and the store info.

**Heads-up: While other users can use the items you add, only you have the power to edit or delete them.**

Want to see everyone's items? No problem! You can access the page to view items created by all users by clicking the highlighted button in the screenshot below:

On the item creation page, fill in the following details:

- Optionally, add a description.

And boom—item created!

### Item detail page

After creating an item, you’ll be taken to its detail page.

**Pro Tip: You can also get to the detail page by clicking on the item’s name in the list view.**

![Item Detail Page](./assets/itemDetailPage.png)

For now, it’s pretty straightforward. You can see the item’s info. Later, one of these cards will show how many shopping lists this item appears on, but for now, we’re keeping things simple.

To get back to the item list page, click the little bag icon in the navigation bar.

### Edit item page

Need to update an item? Click the pencil icon next to the item you want to change.

![Edit and Delete](./assets/editAndDelete.png)

On the update page, you’ll notice placeholders in the fields. These show the current values. Leave any fields blank if you don’t want to change them.

In this example, I updated the price of my item "Coffee" but left everything else the same:

![Update Item Page](./assets/updateItem.png)

Now, when we go back to the list view, we can see the updated price:

To delete an item, click the bin icon next to the item you want to remove.

![Edit and Delete](./assets/editAndDelete.png)

On the delete page, just hit the "Delete item" button, and it’s gone!
