# ShoppingListApp

Welcome to the **ShoppingListApp**! üéâ

## Overview

Ever found yourself staring at a shopping list that just doesn't cut it? Same here! That's why I created this app ‚Äî because I could never find a ShoppingListApp that met my needs. This is a personal project born out of sheer frustration (and maybe a little too much time spent on the couch). 

This app allows households to **share items**, **stores**, and **shopping lists** with each other, all while keeping an eye on that budget. Say goodbye to the chaos of last-minute shopping trips and missed items! With **ShoppingListApp**, you can collaboratively manage your shopping endeavors like a pro. üõíüí∏

**IMPORTANT: ShoppingListApp is a hobby project and is not intended to be run in a production environment, it was made with a home network in mind. If you do run this in a production environment, do so at your own risk. You are welcome to adjust the code to suit your needs or create your own implementation using some of the code that is part of this project.**

**NOTE: ShoppingListApp is still under development and still on its way to V1 release.**

**NOTE: Unfortunately, ShoppingListApp will have poor mobile support with the V1 release, this will be addressed in V2.**

## Why?

Because I wanted to! üéà I built this app to solve a problem I faced and to learn something new along the way. Plus, it was a fun distraction from my usual coding routine.
