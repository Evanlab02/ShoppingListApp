# ShoppingListApp

Welcome to the **ShoppingListApp**! 🎉

## Overview

Ever found yourself staring at a shopping list that just doesn't cut it? Same here! That's why I created this app — because I could never find a ShoppingListApp that met my needs. This is a personal project born out of sheer frustration (and maybe a little too much time spent on the couch). 

This app allows households to **share items**, **stores**, and **shopping lists** with each other, all while keeping an eye on that budget. Say goodbye to the chaos of last-minute shopping trips and missed items! With **ShoppingListApp**, you can collaboratively manage your shopping endeavors like a pro. 🛒💸

NOTE: ShoppingListApp is still under development and still on its way to V1 release.
NOTE: Unfortunately, ShoppingListApp will have poor mobile support with the V1 release, this will be addressed in V2.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **Frontend:** React
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Features

- **Share Items:** Allow others to use shopping items easily that you have created.
- **Store Management:** Keep track of your favorite stores and their offerings.
- **Collaborative Lists:** Create shopping lists that everyone can access and update.
- **Budget Tracking:** Manage your household budget together — because money matters!

## Why?

Because I wanted to! 🎈 I built this app to solve a problem I faced and to learn something new along the way. Plus, it was a fun distraction from my usual coding routine. 

Feel free to check it out, contribute, or just laugh at my coding choices. Happy shopping! 🛍️
