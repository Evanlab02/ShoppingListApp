### Items Page

On this page you can view all the items you created, you will also be able to navigate to their detail, edit or delete pages. You can also access the detail page of each store where you can view all the items of a store and the details about the store.

**NOTE: All items can be used by other users but only you can edit/delete them.**

You are also able to access the page where you view all items that have been created by all users by clicking on the button highlighted in the below screenshot:

![Create Item Button](./assets/createItemButton.png)

Once you are on the item creation page, you will need to fill in the following details:

- Item Name
- Store item belongs to
- The price
- And optionally, the description of the item.

And then you can create your item.

### Item detail page

After you create an item, you will be taken to its detail page.

**NOTE: You can also get to the detail page by clicking on the name of the item from the item list view/page.**

![Item Detail Page](./assets/itemDetailPage.png)

Here you can view all the details of the item, at this stage there is not much to see here.

In future, one of the cards will display the number of shopping lists this item is on but further than that, this is a very basic page.

To go back to the item list view/page, click on the little bag icon in the navigation bar.

### Edit item page

To edit an item, you can click on the pencil icon within the table for the specific item you want to update.

![Edit and Delete](./assets/editAndDelete.png)

When you arrive on the update page, you will notice some of the fields have placeholders. These placeholders will be the previous values which were on the item, you can leave any of these fields blank and it will not update that field for the item (Meaning it will stay the same as is in the placeholder).

In the example below, I have updated one of my items "Coffee" to have a different price but keep everything else the same.

![Update Item Page](./assets/updateItem.png)

Now in the list view, we will see the new price of the item.

![Post update item](./assets/postUpdateItem.png)

### Delete item page

Now to delete an item, you can click on the bin icon within the table for the specific item you want to delete.

Once you are on the delete page, you can click the "Delete item" button and it will delete this item/record.
